### A description of which examples will work by March 11, including any updates you want to make to the examples you plan for March 11 (itâ€™s OK to scale back or up depending on where you got!)
All examples will work by March 11.

Implemented and working:  
- Static allocation of strings
- Concatenating two strings
- Printing strings
- Slicing strings (inlcuding advanced slicing operations)
- len function for strings
- String comparison
- Escape sequences

In-progress:  
- Loop iterators

### A description of the biggest challenge you faced in your week of implementation
1. Figuring out a way to allocate the temporary variables for iterators. 
2. Accessing and allocating wasm memory from TypeScript.
