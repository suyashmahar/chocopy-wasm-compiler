### A description of which examples will work by March 11, including any updates you want to make to the examples you plan for March 11 (itâ€™s OK to scale back or up depending on where you got!)
All examples will work by March 11.

Implemented and working:  
- Static allocation of strings
- Concatenating two strings
- Printing strings
- Slicing strings (inlcuding advanced slicing operations)
- len function for strings
- String comparison
- Escape sequences

In-progress:  
- Loop iterators

### A description of the biggest challenge you faced in your week of implementation
1. Figuring out a way to allocate the temporary variables for iterators. 
2. Accessing and allocating wasm memory from TypeScript.


## Example programs that couldn't be implemented
### First
Formatting strings:
```python
print("%s %s" % ("Hello!", "World")
```

### Second
Assining new value to string iterators:

*Description*: Python supports assigning value to the iterator without
changing the underlying string. This currently prevented by typecheck
in my implementation.

```python
hello: str = "Hello"
iter: str = None

for iter in Hello:
	iter = "a"  # This changes the value of the iterator but not the string
	print(iter) # 'a'
	
print(hello)    # 'Hello'
```

### Third
Support for more escape sequences, e.g., `\r` for carriage return.

```python
print("Hello\rWorld") # World
```
